This repository contains a sample app that I use to give workshops geared towards beginners to Flutter. I've made an effort to keep the git history clean by doing cohesive commits that each represent a teachable building block in the app.


## Contains examples of:

* Basic widgets and building layouts
* Internationalization
* Navigation & routing
* Networking
* JSON parsing and serialization
* BLoC pattern
* Storing key-value data on disk
* Dependency injection with InheritedWidget
* Unit and widget tests
* Configuring linting rules to implement the Effective Dart guidelines
* Continuous integration pipelines with Travis CI
* Uploading code coverage to Codecov


## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view the 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
